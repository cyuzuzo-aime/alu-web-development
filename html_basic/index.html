    <h1>This is a Level 1 Heading</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph.  It contains some text to demonstrate how paragraphs are displayed in HTML. Paragraphs are used to structure text content, making it easier to read.</p>

    <h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
    <p>This is the second paragraph.  It can contain more text, and the text will wrap automatically to fit the width of the browser window.  You can add line breaks, but it's generally better to let the browser handle wrapping.</p>

    <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
    <p>This is the third paragraph.  It demonstrates the use of a third level heading.  Headings are important for creating a document outline and improving accessibility.</p>

    <p>This is the fourth and final paragraph.  It includes a clickable image.  The image is wrapped in an anchor tag, which makes it a link.</p>
